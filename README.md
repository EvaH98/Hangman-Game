# Hangman-Game

<h2>Hangman, the classic pen and paper guessing game we all know and love is coming to you on  your computer screens!</h2>

<p>Normally, you'd have a second person come up with a word and have you guess it, well with the power of vanilla Javascript, you just need yourself and your brain. Making the experience eco friendly (no more paper!) and more convenient(if you don't have another person to play with)</p>

<h3>The theme: Classic Arcade!<h3>
<h3>Think: Most popular arcade games (google it if you have to)</h3>

<h3>The Rules:</h3>
<p>1. Press any key to start.
<br>
2. If the letter you pressed is part of the word, the underscores will change to the letter.
<br>
3. If the letter is wrong, your lives will go down and you'll be able to see your last guess to avoid repetition.
<br>
4. Win: Get congratulated!
<br>
5. Loose: Well, better luck next time.
